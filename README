The dcollect.sh and dcollect.p are to be used to collect the data that you will use in your report.
They will also be used to test that your solutions works.

The script, dcollect.sh, has three relevant variables; portFORK, portTHREAD and testing.
portFORK and portTHREAD are to match the port number where your servers are listening too. 
We use testing to determine if the script runs in a test mode, or in the real data collection mode.
The difference is in the amount of data that is collected. In the real mode it will collect
60*32 samples, while in test mode only 5*10 samples. Note that your submission should of course be
using the real mode.

dcollect.sh does a couple of important tasks.
 1) Verify that your servers can serve basic content. This is done by sending a random string into
    the file randomFile. Then it verifies that it can download this file from your server, using CURL.
    Hence, your server needs to be good enough that CURL can work with it. If this fails, the script
    exits with an 'ERROR' statement.
 2) Verifies that your server can serve any file. This is done by creating a randomly name file
    in the same folder as the script, and servers, are executing. It then again uses CURL to verify
    that it can download that randomly named file, from your servers. If it can, the scrip exits with
    an 'ERROR' statement.
 3) Collects data, calculates statistics, and renders a graph (statistics.png) regarding performance.
    As mentioned before there are two modes, testing (testing=1) and real (testing=0).
    If there are any problems during the data collection, the scrip exits with an 'ERROR' statment.
